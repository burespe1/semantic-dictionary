>The "location of public transport stops and interchange points" is a data category which exists in Transmodel/NeTEx and in INSPIRE. This represents an overlap with DR (EU) 2017/1926, namely: the location may be represented as a Postal Address, as a Road Address or as coordinates in a specific location referencing system. INSPIRE is the reference for the Postal Address format, whereas NeTEx is a reference for the Road Address format (see conclusions of the project "Inspire support to MMTIS").
