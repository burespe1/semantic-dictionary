>A charging pool denotes an area equipped with one or more charging stations. These charging stations can take the form of fixed wall-mounted appliances (wallboxes) or self-standing units, both of which are connected to an electrical supply point. Depending on the number of charging points integrated into a single station, they can facilitate the simultaneous charging of multiple electric vehicles. A charging point may be fitted with several connectors but can only charge one vehicle at a time.

>The minimum information package must encompass the exact location of the charging infrastructure, contact options, opening times, a list of accepted payment methods, as well as information on the connector type. Information on location may be separated into exit and entrance location for larger areas or areas with strict rules for driving directions (e.g., along motorways).

>Based on the functional mapping of IDACS data requirements to DATEX II RSPs as well as the service profile of the DATEX II data model for energy infrastructure, the conditions for the use of charging points for electric vehicles may encompass the following aspects: a) opening hours (i.e., the period in which a charging point is accessible to the public), b) supported payment methods (e.g., active RFID chip, via an app, via calypso, on cash, by credit card, by debit card, etc.), c) available charging modes considering IEC 61851-1 specifications, d) available connectors (e.g., plugs, sockets, induction plates, etc.), e) whether it is possible, not possible, or mandatory for users to make a reservation, f) the types of vehicles that can be charged (e.g., electric buses, electric cars, electric motorcycles, electric bikes, electric boats, motorhomes, others), g) the maximum and minimum delivery amount, h) the available voltage and charging power, and i) information on the applied pricing policy (e.g., charging time based, delivery unit based, contract, flat rate, other).
