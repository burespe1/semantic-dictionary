>Safe and secure truck parking areas are not explicitly mentioned in this definition as they fall into the scope of DR (EU) 885/2015. SSTPAs can be addressed as a subset of rest areas (or in a separate manner if they strictly operate as such).

>Location information can be provided as coordinates, locations along linear elements, or areal locations. As regards service areas, it shall be clarified whether locations refer to entries/exits locations and/or center of gravity.

>"The location of places where vehicles are allowed to park" is present in Transmodel/NeTEx and thus an overlap with EU 2017/1926 exists. Since it is important to exactly relate parking locations to Public Transport access points this is an appropriate overlap for integrating data sets.
