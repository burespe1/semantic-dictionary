label: geometry
definition: the minimum information required for representing in a centerline or more precise manner the geometry of a road networkâ€™s links that connect two positions and therefore form a continuous path (without branches).

>Considering that road links constitute curvilinear elements, their geometry, according to INSPIRE data specifications, can be represented through the GM_Curve object included in the GM_Object hierarchy (ISO 19107).

>Alternatively, geometry can be provided through a piecewise linear representation.
