>Lane closures can be discerned into planned and unplanned in a similar fashion with "road closures".

>Their unambiguous description requires the provision of information about their time validity (applies to planned lane closures) or time of occurrence (applies to unplanned lane closures).

>NOTE: According to ETSI TS 102 894-2 (DF=ClosedLanes), information on lane closure may clarify the status of a lane or a set of lanes by distinguishing between inner hardshoulders, outer hardshoulders, and driving lanes (innerhardShoulderStatus, outerhardShoulderStatus, drivingLaneStatus).
