>Vehicles are said to be in queue when the inflow rate in a road section exceeds the outflow rate.

>The point of traffic queue dissipation typically coincides with junctions/intersections in congested urban road networks. However, in sparse road networks queueing can happen upstream at a junction/intersection for various reasons, such as road accidents.

>The length of a queue may be simply defined as the interval between the point of queue dissipation and the last vehicle in queue. It can be measured in distance units or by the number of queueing objects.
