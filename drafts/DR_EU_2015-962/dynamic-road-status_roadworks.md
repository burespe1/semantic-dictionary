>Roadworks typically affect (fully or partially) individual lanes and seldom all lanes of a given direction, such that travel in this direction is still possible. In case that roadworks affect all lanes, such that travel in a given direction is no longer possible, they match with road closures.

>Roadworks are also discerned into planned and unplanned.

>**Planned roadworks**: Correspond to **scheduled** maintenance, construction, or repair activities carried out on entire road links or specific segments/sections. Such activities are typically pre-arranged and announced in advance by local authorities or road operators to minimize traffic disturbances and enable road users plan alternative routes.\
>**Unplanned roadworks**: Correspond to maintenance, repair, or construction activities that are undertaken **unexpectedly** and without prior scheduling. Such activities are typically initiated in response to urgent issues, such as road damage or infrastructure failures that require immediate actions.

>The unambiguous description of roadworks requires the provision of information about their time validity (i.e., start/estimated end time - if both possible for unplanned roadworks). The provision of such information facilitates their classification into _short-term_ and _long-term_ ones.

> Note: ETSI TS 102 894-2 (DE=DE_RoadworksSubCauseCode) distinguishes the following roadwork types (subcauses).
