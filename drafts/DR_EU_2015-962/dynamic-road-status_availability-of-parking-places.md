>Based on the documentation of the DATEX II parking publication, parking infrastructure encompasses urban or interurban parking sites and on-street parking places. Therefore, the dynamic information provided about parking sites should encompass both their state (e.g., open, full, closed) and status (i.e., number of available parking spots).
