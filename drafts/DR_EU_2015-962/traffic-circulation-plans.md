>Traffic Circulation Plans (TCPs) are crafted by local authorities to manage and direct traffic flows based on recurring traffic conditions, seasonal variations, and pre-existing restrictions (such as school zones). These plans enclose strategies and measures, including, for example, the designation of particular road links that certain users or vehicle types should avoid, aimed at improving traffic flow conditions and achieving societal objectives like lowering emissions and minimizing accidents. The strategies implemented within TCPs are part of a broader, more enduring “traffic control policy”, meaning that the imposed measures remain active and applicable irrespective of the level of achievement of their overarching goal. TCPs are reviewed and updated by local authorities with a certain time frequency.

>On the other hand, Traffic Management Plans (TMPs) provide for the allocation of traffic control measures in response to specific predefined (or not) traffic scenarios, such as the management of heavy congestion or the closure of strategic routes due to extreme weather events, maintenance works, or a serious road accident. The objective of TMPs is to anticipate arrangements for controlling and guiding traffic flows in real-time conditions and informing road users about the traffic situation in a consistent and timely manner. TMPs, which differ in detail according to local circumstances, apply in the following cases:\
•	major traffic accidents\
•	congested traffic\
•	extreme weather conditions\
•	natural or technological catastrophes\
•	special events (sports, cultural, leisure) resulting in unusually high traffic volumes, capacity constraints, or temporary road closures.

>TMPs are either proactive or reactive to traffic conditions and events. They may be planned in advance (e.g., for managing cross-border traffic flows or in relation to specific weather events and road closures) and involve several traffic management authorities (e.g., more than one TMCs) due to the need for activating various traffic management measures, often requiring negotiation, acceptance, confirmation, and feedback. TMP may also be built in response to unexpected conditions and events (reactively) through real-time negotiation.

>The structural components of TMPs are:\
•	Title of the plan\
•	Concerned area\
•	Precise localization (location markers) and traffic direction\
•	Map-based information (indication of section(s) closed, diversions, rerouting, etc.)\
•	Applicable measures/traffic management procedures\
•	Coordinating actor\
•	Description of TMP workflow (activation request → implementation request → acknowledgements → implementation and information → suspension/deactivation request → acknowledgements)\
•	Actions of stakeholders and competent authorities\
•	Information and communication actions (e.g., traffic signs, radio messages, etc.)\
•	Related traffic restrictions (e.g., along the diversion routes)

>TCPs can be defined in a similar fashion to TMPs or in a more simplified manner. However, the key difference between TCPs and TMPs is that TMPs are deactivated when the event or condition (scenario) that has triggered their activation is resolved (which is not the case for TCPs).
