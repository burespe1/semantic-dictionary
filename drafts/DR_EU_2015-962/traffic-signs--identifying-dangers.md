>The following conditions/restrictions are mentioned in the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/962:\
•	Access conditions for tunnels (legal or physical restrictions/limitations on vehicles to access a specific tunnel)\

•	Permanent access restrictions (permanent legal or physical restrictions/limitations on vehicles to access a specific road link of any type)\
•	Other traffic regulations (other traffic regulations that apply along specific road links of any type)

>Considering that traffic signs correspond to specific points on a road link and may apply to specific directions, their location can be encoded through either the point or linear location referencing methods mentioned in the description of the SRTI data categories.

>Access restrictions/limitations can on a case-by-case basis be weight-, vehicle type-, and propulsion technology-related or depend on infrastructure categorization (e.g., tunnel categories).

>According to CEN/TS 17268 (TN-ITS model), other traffic regulations may involve mandatory turns to be taken, prohibited turns, prohibited stopping, prohibited use of audible devices, mandatory use of snow chains. CEN/TS 17268 TN-ITS model supports the provision of any traffic sign defined in the ISO 14826 graphic data dictionary (GDD).
