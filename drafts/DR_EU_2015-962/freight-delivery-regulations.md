>Freight delivery regulations are typically developed by local authorities to help manage traffic flow and reduce the impact of freight vehicles on the road network. Their goal is to balance the needs of freight and passenger transportation. Freight delivery regulations may enclose additional information for clarifying the applicable type of freight (e.g., dangerous goods).
