>"Accidents" and "incidents" are used to describe different types of situations/events with implications on prevailing traffic conditions (obstruction).

>**Accidents:** Typically correspond to unexpected situations/events that may result in damage to vehicles, injuries, or loss of life. Such situations/events may include collisions between vehicles, single-vehicle accidents (e.g., running off the road or hitting a stationary object), or accidents between vehicles and pedestrians, cyclists, or other vulnerable road users.\
>**Incidents:** Typically encompass a broader range of situations/events, i.e., any unplanned or unexpected situation/event that disrupts the normal flow of traffic, even if it does not involve a collision or injuries. This may include breakdowns, vehicle fires, spilled cargo, road debris, or even non-traffic-related situations/events like protests or animals on the roadway.

>The unambiguous description of accidents/incidents requires the provision of information about their type and time of occurrence.

> Note: ETSI TS 102 894-2 (DE=AccidentSubCauseCode) distinguishes the following accident types (subcauses).
