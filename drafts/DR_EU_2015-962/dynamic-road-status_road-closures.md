>Road closures are typically directional and discerned into planned and unplanned.

>**Planned road closures:** Correspond to **scheduled** shutdowns of entire road links (all lanes per direction) or sections of a given road link for various reasons, such as large public events. Such closure are typically announced in advance to enable road users plan alternative routes and minimize disruption to their travel plans and diaries.\
>**Unplanned road closures:** Correspond to **unexpected** shutdown of entire road links (all lanes per direction) or sections of a given road link without prior notice due to unforeseen events, such as sudden infrastructure failures. Such closures typically disrupt traffic flow in a mode-agnostic or mode-specific manner, causing substantial delays.

>The unambiguous description of road closures requires the provision of information about their time validity (applies to planned road closures) or time of occurrence (applies to unplanned road closures).
