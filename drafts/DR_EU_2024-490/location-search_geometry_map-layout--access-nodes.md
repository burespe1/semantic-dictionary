    <td colspan="2" style="text-align: left">Equipment may be represented on a SCHEMATIC MAP:  A map representing schematically the layout of the topographic structure of PLACEs (e.g., a set of SITEs) or the public transport network (a set of LINEs), or other entity with a geometric projection (e.g., DECK PLAN for a train, vessel or aircraft). It can include a pixel projection of a set of ENTITies onto a bitmap image so as to support hyperlinked interactions.</th>

    <td colspan="2" style="text-align: left">The nature of amenities available at an access node can be specified as FACILITies and LOCAL SERVICEs. Further detailed information can be provided using EQUIPMENT of different types (e.g., LIFT EQUIPMENT, TICKET EQUIPMENT, ENTRANCE EQUIPMENT, etc.). Within an access node EQUIPMENT can be exactly located using an EQUIPMENT POSITION.</th>

  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" style="text-align: left">The topographical structure of an access node can be described through the spatial layout of its subcomponents and by explicit links between them, over which a trip planner may compute a route through a site. The plan of a STOP PLACE and the paths through it can be visualized on a digital map.</th>
