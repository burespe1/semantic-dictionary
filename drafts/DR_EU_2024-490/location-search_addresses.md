>BEST PRACTICES\
• Addresses that appear in this data type are mostly relevant to the postal address.\
• Examples of this are: building numbers, street numbers, postcodes linked with coordinates or other location references (coordinates will be supplied according to WGS84).\
• When talking of the origin and destination of a trip, it should be made clear if the reference for origin and destination is the physical location of the departure or arrival of the customer’s trip (e.g. from home and to a shopping mall), or the public transport point of origin and destination. In the latter case you need to add information about an access and egress trip leg which is most often not done by public transport (except if you order a taxi or an Uber-like service or some on-demand shuttles).\
• Based on INSPIRE data specification, the postal address constitutes a hierarchy consisting of components with an increasing level of detail, e.g., town, street name, and house number or house name. It may also include a post code or other postal descriptors.\
>Both types of addresses may be used:\
o The reference for postal address format is INSPIRE.\
o The reference for road address is NeTEx.
