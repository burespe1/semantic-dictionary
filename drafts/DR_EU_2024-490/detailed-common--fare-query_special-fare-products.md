Another typical example is the access to a parking for a certain time followed by the access to a transport network. Such combined FARE PRODUCTs are considered a FARE PRODUCTs in their own right. Transmodel/NeTEx expresses the combination of the parameters determining the validity of such combined FARE PRODUCTs. Such combinations are often resulting from contracts between product owners/operators and allow for a special price (when used as combinations and not separately). The combined access rights are considered as FARE PRODUCTs in their own right an have to be validated in one go (as one single access right).</td>
