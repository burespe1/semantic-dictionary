>BEST PRACTICES\
Information of the availability of parking space should ideally specify the accessibility of parking places for wheelchair users (as they require more space for accessing and leaving the vehicle).

>More details on the content and structure of on-street or off-street parking availibility data can be found on the data dictionary of the DATEX II Parking Publication light.
