Such NAVIGATION PATHs (either between SITEs or within SITEs) may be projected (see Transmodel/NeTEx PROJECTION mechanism) on the road infrastructure to provide the physical layout of the pedestrian network.</th>

>BEST PRACTICES\
In line with the previous data category, the scope of the current one is limited to personal modes. There is a gap in INSPIRE, namely the classes/attributes of the INSPIRE data specification can to a certain extent be used for walkways and pedestrian zones that are adjacent to/interface with the remaining road network, i.e., road segments the FormOfWayValue of which is walkway or pedestrianZone. Pedestrian zones represent segments of road networks reserved for pedestrian use and closed for regular vehicular use by means of physical barriers (INSPIRE-reference).
