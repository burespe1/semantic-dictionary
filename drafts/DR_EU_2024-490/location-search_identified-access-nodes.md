    <td>A place comprising one or more locations where vehicles may stop and where passengers may board or leave vehicles (QUAYs) or prepare for their trip. The STOP PLACE is entered through designated ENTRANCEs and may also contain ACCESS SPACEs (locations passed through to reach the QUAYs). A STOP PLACE will usually have one or more well-known names.</td>

>BEST PRACTICES\
• From a topological point of view, access nodes for public transport are zero-dimensional nodes of the transport networks (road, rail, etc.), that may be located by coordinates in a particular Coordinate Reference System, used for the spatial description of the network, where passengers may board or alight from vehicles.\
• From a geographical point of view, access nodes are places that appear in the timetable as locations where vehicles may stop, and passengers may board or alight from vehicles.
