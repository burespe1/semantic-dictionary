>BEST PRACTICES\
• When you order a flight or a long-distance train, you need to be sure that the interchange time proposed in your trip planner allows you to transfer from one PT vehicle to another in normal conditions of operations. The minimum interchange time proposed in the booking phase and accepted when purchasing the tickets must be accepted by the operators.\
• In case your first PT leg arrival time is delayed, you should be informed when you plan your trip and of course when you perform your trip what shall happen in case of incident: e.g. if your next PT vehicle shall wait for you, or what options are proposed if your next PT vehicle is no longer there.
