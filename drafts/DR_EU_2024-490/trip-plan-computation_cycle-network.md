>There is no dedicated-reference European data standard for this data category. Cycling Network is standardised by ISO TC204 (GDF standard) and as mentioned here only partially by INSPIRE. The classes/attributes of the INSPIRE data specification can to a certain extent be used for segregated cycle streets that are parts of/adjacent to road networks, i.e., road segments the FormOfWayValue of which is bicycleRoad.

>BEST PRACTICES\
Three sub-categories of bikes should be considered:\
• private bikes (used privately), which can be used - for moving or for parking - on roads or streets or dedicated infrastructure (or even shared with pedestrian areas or pedestrian crossings at traffic lights).\
• bike-sharing, which requires specific organisation of services and fare/ticketing (with sub-categories of e-bikes), but which are used for moving in the same conditions as private bikes.\
• bikes boarded in collective public transport modes, which are no longer used as a transport mode.\
In addition to cycling, the category of “e-scooters” should also be analysed separately with the same three sub-categories.
