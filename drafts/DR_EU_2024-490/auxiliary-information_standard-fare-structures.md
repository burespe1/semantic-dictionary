>Fare structures can be broadly discerned into:\
• Space-based structures: flat or progressive, zonal- or interval-based, point-to-point, etc. Interval-based fares may be based on simple distances, numbers of zones, border points, etc.\
• Time-based structures: flat or progressive depending upon time intervals.\
• Combination of the two (e.g., fare products based on both zones and time intervals).
