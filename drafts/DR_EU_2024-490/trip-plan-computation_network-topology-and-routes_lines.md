    <td>FLEXIBLE STOP PLACE</td>
    <td>A specialisation of the STOP PLACE describing a stop of a FLEXIBLE SERVICE. It may be composed of FLEXIBLE AREAs or HAIL AND RIDE AREAs identifying the catchment areas for flexible services (when they use areas or flexible quays). Some FLEXIBLE SERVICE also uses regular STOP PLACEs for their stops.</td>

>BEST PRACTICES\
The topology of service networks is defined by routes, lines, and service patterns.
