>Based on Delegated Regulation (EU) 886/2013, the events or conditions to be covered by the road safety-related minimum universal traffic information service shall consist of at least one of the following categories:\
•	Temporary slippery road (unforeseen condition of the road surface which makes it slippery for a certain amount of time, causing low adherence of the vehicle to the road)\
•	Animal, people, obstacles, debris on the road (situation where animals, debris, obstacles or people are positioned on the road where one would not expect to find them so that an emergency maneuver might be required to avoid them)\
•	Unprotected accident area (area where an accident has occurred, and which has not yet been secured by the competent authority; typically enabled by crowdsourcing apps)[^1]\
•	Short-term road works (temporary road works that are carried out on the road or on the side of the road and which are indicated only by minimum signing because of the short-term nature of these works)\
•	Reduced visibility (visibility affected by any condition that reduces the sight range of drivers and which might affect safe driving)\
•	Wrong-way driver (vehicle travelling on the wrong side of a divided carriageway against the oncoming traffic)\
•	Unmanaged blockage of a road (any blockage of a road, partial or total, which has not been adequately secured and signposted)\
•	Exceptional weather conditions (unusual, severe, or unseasonal weather conditions which might affect safe driving)

[^1]: Some countries have integrated accident within unprotected accident area as an additional category of event/condition.

>Standards and protocols utilized by road operators and service providers (DATEX II, DENM, RDS-TMC or TPEG2-TEC) hold a significantly wide vocabulary of event and condition types. Based on a joint effort of TISA, Data for Road Safety Collaboration, DATEX II, and C2C Communication Consortium, these types of events and conditions have been reduced to a common denominator (superset) under which the messages and information provided by using any standard or protocol are equivalent. This superset, encompassing both the impact and cause of an event (see the table below), simplifies the vocabulary that could be used in practice for providing warnings to road users.
