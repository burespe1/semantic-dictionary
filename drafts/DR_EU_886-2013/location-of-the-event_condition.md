>The location of an event/condition can correspond to a single geospatial point on a road (point), a part of a road network defined between two points on the same road including an indication of the applicable direction (linear), or a geographic or geometric two-dimensional feature (area). Several methods exist for encoding point, linear, or area locations.

>The encoding of point locations can be achieved as follows:\
•	Point by coordinates\
•	Point along linear element\
•	TPEG Point Location\
•	ALERT-C Point\
•	OpenLR Point

>The encoding of linear locations can be achieved as follows:\
•	Linear within linear element location\
•	ALERT-C linear\
•	TPEG Linear Location\
•	OpenLR Linear\
•	GmlLineString

>The encoding of area locations can be achieved as follows:\
•	ALERT-C area\
•	TPEG Area Location\
•	named Area\
•	GmlMultiPolygon\
•	OpenLR Area
