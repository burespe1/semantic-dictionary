>The “state” of the truck parking area generally refers to the physical condition or the inherent characteristics of a truck parking area at any given time. This might include its capacity (number of parking spots available), infrastructure quality (e.g., pavement condition, lighting), and available amenities (e.g., rest areas, fuel stations, maintenance facilities).

>The “status” of the truck parking area typically refers to the current operational condition of the truck parking area. This may, for example, include whether it is open, closed, or full at the moment.
