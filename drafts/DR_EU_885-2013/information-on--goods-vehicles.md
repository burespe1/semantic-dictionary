>The designation of a vehicle as a “specific goods vehicle” may often mean that it must comply with particular regulatory standards, safety requirements, and possibly possess special permits to operate. The specifics can vary by jurisdiction, but generally, this category includes vehicles that are equipped, structured, or modified in a way that makes them suitable for carrying defined types of cargo. This can range from refrigerated trucks for perishable items, tankers for liquids or gases, flatbeds for heavy machinery or construction materials, to vehicles with special containers for hazardous substances.

>Specific goods vehicles require different kinds of amenities to ensure steady ambient conditions (in case of refrigerated goods vehicles) or the safety and security of their surroundings (in case of dangerous goods vehicles).
