>Security and safety equipment are primarily concerned with protecting people and property (e.g., fences, barriers, cameras), while service equipment is focused on providing necessary amenities and services to truck and commercial vehicle drivers (e.g., motel, toilets, water pumps).

>Relevant information portals distinguish the amenities offered by truck parking areas into: a) security amenities, b) comfort amenities, and c) infrastructural (service) amenities. Typical examples include (security amenities) fences and barriers, (comfort amenities) shower, medical care, and hotel, and (service ammenities) truck wash, fuel station, truck repair, and power supply. The current data category may also involve the assessment of the security level of a parking area (e.g., following a five-start ranking) and the conformance to certain standards and requirements (e.g., TAPA or ESPORG certified parking area).
