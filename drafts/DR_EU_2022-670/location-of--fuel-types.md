>Each station must have at least one refill point allowing the refuelling of one vehicle at a time. The minimum information package must encompass the exact location of the whole infrastructure (including refuelling points), contact options, opening times, a list of accepted payment methods, as well as information on the allowed vehicle characteristics (e.g., size, weight).  Information on location may be separated into exit and entrance location for larger areas or areas with strict rules for driving directions (e.g., along motorways). Additionally, crucial details involve specifying the provided type of fuel.
