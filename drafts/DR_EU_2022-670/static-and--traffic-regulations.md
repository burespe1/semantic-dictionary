>Traffic regulations comprise of machine-interpretable rules and restrictions that control vehicle (or pedestrian) movement on the road network to ensure safety and traffic efficiency. According to DR (EU) 2022/670 crucial traffic regulations in the scope of the current data category are categorized as follows:\
•	access conditions for tunnels (legal or physical restrictions/limitations on vehicles to access a specific tunnel; may be expressed through tunnel classes)\
•	access conditions for bridges (legal or physical restrictions/limitations on vehicles to access a specific bridge)\
•	permanent access restrictions (permanent legal or physical restrictions/limitations on vehicles to access a specific road link of any type)\
•	speed limits (legal maximum or minimum speeds on specific road segment(s), varying by road type, conditions, time of day and vehicle categories)\
•	freight delivery regulations (regulations for delivering freight, such as designation of certain road links or areas, loading/unloading permissions or prohibitions, and time-related restrictions)\
•	overtaking bans on heavy goods vehicles (dynamic information disseminating the prohibition of overtaking by heavy goods vehicles on specific segments of a road link (or on the entire link) due to adverse on-going conditions)\
•	weight/length/width/height restrictions (vehicle size and weight limitations on specific segments of the road)\
•	one-way streets (road segments where traffic is allowed to move in only one direction)\
•	boundaries of restrictions, prohibitions or obligations with zonal validity, current access status and conditions for circulation in regulated traffic zones (defined areas with specific traffic rules, including restricted access zones, their boundaries, and the current rules or conditions for vehicles entering these zones)\
•	direction of travel on reversible lanes (regulations indicating the direction that vehicles should travel on lanes where the direction is changeable based on traffic needs or time of day)

>According to DATEX II model, traffic regulations can be established by: (a) competent authorities (e.g., national/local transport authorities) in the form of legal orders, (b) authorized actors (e.g., road operators) in response to specific urgent or safety-related conditions, or (c) automated and controllable technical systems.

>Information exchanged in the context of the current data category encompass, where relevant: (a) specification of legal basis (relevant for traffic regulations established by competent authorities), (b) indication of applicable location, (c) indication of time validity, (d) indication of other applicability conditions, and (e) description of traffic regulation type.

>NOTES on speed limits\
According to ETSI TS 102 894-2 (DE=SpeedLimit), speed limits can be applied to a geographical position, a road link, or a geographical region. Hence, the applicable area or part of road infrastructure can be reflected by the utilized location references.\
Considering INSPIRE data specification on transport networks, information that should be provided for identifying a speed limit involves: a) an indication of whether it corresponds to a maximum or minimum speed, b) the value of the maximum or minimum speed (as applies), c) an indication of the direction that the speed limit is applicable, d) an indication of the lanes including the start lane (counted from the right hand) for which the speed limit applies, e) an indication of the applicable vehicle type, e) an indication of the period during which the speed limit is valid, and f) an indication of the weather conditions the speed limit is dependent on (if any).\
The vehicle class dependent nature of speed limits is also recognized in the PIARC data dictionary.
