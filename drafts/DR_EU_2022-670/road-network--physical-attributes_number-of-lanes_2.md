>This information may be limited to regular traffic lanes or extended to cover additional components of the road surface (see above). In the latter case, it should additionally provide insights into which of those components can serve vehicular traffic and their respective contribution to directional traffic capacity to provide unambiguous information to traffic management-related use cases.

>NOTE: Driving lanes, according to ETSI TS 102 894-2, are counted from the inside border of the road excluding the hardshoulder.
