>Temporary/dynamic traffic management measures are usually developed by traffic managers with the aim of controlling and guiding traffic flows in response to unexpected/non-recurring traffic disturbances, but also with the aim of increasing road safety. Therefore, they are linked to Traffic Management Plans (TMPs). For more details, please consult the descriptions under the "Traffic circulation plans" static data category.

>Temporary traffic management measures may include modifications in traffic regulations (e.g., modified speed limits or overtaking prohibitions) as a result of the above data categories (e.g., roadworks, road/lane closures).
