>Poor road conditions may happen due to various reasons. For more details, please consult SRTI data categories.

>The unambiguous description of poor road conditions requires the provision of information about the time of their occurrence and type (optionally).

> Note: ETSI TS 102 894-2 (DE=AdverseWeatherCondition-AdhesionSubCauseCode) distinguishes the following types (subcauses) of poor road conditions related to **low adhesion**.

>|--------------|------------------------|
>| 0          | Unavailable: when further detailed information on the cause of the low road adhesion is not available  |
>| 1          | Low adhesion due to heavy frost on the road  |
>| 2          | Low adhesion due to fuel on the road  |
>| 3          | Low adhesion due to mud on the road  |
>| 4          | Low adhesion due to snow on the road  |
>| 5          | Low adhesion due to ice on the road  |
>| 6          | Low adhesion due to black ice on the road  |
>| 7          | Low adhesion due to oil on the road  |
>| 8          | Low adhesion due to loose gravel or stone fragments detached from a road surface or from a hazard  |
>| 9          | Low adhesion due to instant black ice on the road surface  |
>| 10          | Low adhesion due to salted road  |
