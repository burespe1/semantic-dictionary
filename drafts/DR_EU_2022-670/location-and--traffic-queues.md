>Vehicles are said to be in queue when the inflow rate in a road section exceeds the outflow rate (or when saturated conditions exist due to traffic demand exceeding traffic capacity).

>The point of traffic queue dissipation typically coincides with junctions/intersections in congested urban road networks. However, in sparse road networks queueing can happen upstream at a junction/intersection for various reasons, such as road accidents.

>A traffic queue is typically a linear element. Its length can be defined as the interval between the point of queue dissipation and the last vehicle in queue (or in other terms the distance between the point where the vehicles are entering the area in which traffic demand exceeds capacity and the point where vehicles are leaving this area). According to PIARC data dictionary, it is a headway object measurable either in distance units or by the number of queueing objects.
