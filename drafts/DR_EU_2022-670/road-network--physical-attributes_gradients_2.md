>This information is typically identified as the maximum gradient along specific links of the road network to highlight restrictions for particular vehicle classes. Provided information may consider the direction of a given road network link, indicating whether the slope ascends (positive value) or descends (negative value), thus providing insights into the direction of elevation change.
