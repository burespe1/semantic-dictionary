>Fixed road user charges are typically vehicle class dependent. A commonly used classification of vehicles for determining the applicable charges along European highways/motorways is the following:\
•	Class 1: Motorcycles, tricycle vehicles\
•	Class 2: Light vehicles (with or without trailer and height less than a threshold value)\
•	Class 3: Trucks, buses, and other heavy-duty vehicles with less than 4 axes (with or without trailer and height greater than a threshold value)\
•	Class 4: Trucks and other heavy-duty vehicles with 4 or more axes

>NOTE: Vehicle classification is country-dependent.

>Fixed road user charges may also be time condition dependent. Time conditions can be discerned into (weekday/weekend) rush and regular periods. 

>Available payment methods in tolled roads may include a) on cash, b) by credit/debit card, c) electronic payment, and d) via toll stickers. Electronic payment can contextually be associated with a free-flow tolling system.
