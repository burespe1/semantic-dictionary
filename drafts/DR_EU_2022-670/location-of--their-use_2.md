>A recharging pool denotes an area equipped with one or more charging stations. These recharging stations can take the form of fixed wall-mounted appliances (wallboxes) or self-standing units, both of which are connected to an electrical supply point. Depending on the number of recharging points integrated into a single station, they can facilitate the simultaneous recharging of multiple electric vehicles. A recharging point may be fitted with several connectors but can only recharge one vehicle at a time. The minimum information package must encompass the exact location of the whole infrastructure (including recharging points), contact options, opening times, a list of accepted payment methods, as well as information on the allowed vehicle characteristics (e.g., size, weight). Information on location may be separated into exit and entrance location for larger areas or areas with strict rules for driving directions (e.g., along motorways).

> CEN/TC 278/WG 8 proposes the following correspondence:\
•	Charging pool (location data, brandname, charge point operator)\
•	Charging stations (physical object, authentication method)\
•	Charging points (data and attributes related to energy delivery)\
•	Connectors/plugs (data and attributes related to physical connectivity)
