# ðŸ“„ Draft Dictionary Items
This folder contains draft entries for semantic dictionary concepts aka **data types**, written in Markdown format with metadata in front matter. Each file includes:

- YAML frontmatter for metadata (e.g. label, definition, language, status)
- Rich content like text, code, and image references

**Index of working data types definitions**: [list of definitions with their status](INDEX.md)

## ðŸ§± File Structure

Each file must:
- Use .md extension
- Start with a YAML metadata block (between --- lines)
- Include a human-readable definition and optionally commentary, diagrams, or citations

### ðŸ§¾ Metadata Fields

| Field | Description | 
| - | - | 
| id | Unique lowercase identifier for the concept (also used as filename) | 
| label | Human-friendly title | 
| definition | Concise explanation of the concept's meaning | 
| category | Domain or grouping the concept belongs to | 
| language | Language code of the definition (e.g. en) | 
| status | Approval state (draft, review, approved, etc.) | 
| source | Citable source or reference (standard, report, etc.) | 
| subcategory | **list of** sub grouping the concept belongs to |


### ðŸ§¾ Workflow

Drafts are manually edited and commented upon via GitHub issues.
Workflow including statuses is in detail described in [**WORKFLOW**](WORKFLOW.md)

Previews are auto-generated in each commit by `generate_preview.py`.
releases are auto generated when committing a version tag  by `generate_releease.py`..

## ðŸ§  Examples

Hereâ€™s an example draft file named: road-classification.md

```markdown
---
id: road-classification_2
label: road classification
definition: the minimum information required for distinguishing the links of a road network encompassing form of way, functional, or other concerns.
category: Types of data on infrastructure
language: en
status: finalised
source: DR_EU_2022-670

>According to ETSI TS 102 894-2 (DE=RoadType), road types are distinguished based on two parameters: (a) urban versus non-urban roads and (b) roads with versus without structural separation to opposite lanes.

>An extended **classification** is provided by the INSPIRE data specification on transport networks (based on EuroRoads and GDF specifications). This classification is based on: (a) â€˜form of wayâ€™ that considers the physical properties of each road link (including accessible mobility modes) and (b) â€˜functional classâ€™ indicating the importance of each road link within the road network. It is important to note that the â€˜form of wayâ€™ and â€˜functional classâ€™ elements may vary in meaning across different European countries due to the lack of harmonization.

>NOTE: The classification of road links is an important aspect to be considered by navigation systems. For example, in certain contexts, main or first-class roads may preferably be used for long-distance traffic (e.g., international traffic), while the lower classes in this hierarchy may preferably be used for regional and local traffic.

Hereâ€™s an example draft file named: road-network--physical-attributes_road-width_2.md

```markdown
---
id: road-network--physical-attributes_road-width_2
label: road width
definition: the minimum information required for indicating the width of a road networkâ€™s links.
category: Types of data on infrastructure
language: en
status: finalised
source: DR_EU_2022-670
subcategory:
  - Road network links and their physical attributes
---

>This information is addressed as encompassing in a discretized and systematic manner the width of various (maintained) components of the road surface, including driving lanes, hard shoulders, medians, parking space, and the roadside.

> NOTE: Driving lanes, according to ETSI TS 102 894-2, are counted from the inside border of the road excluding the hard shoulder.

> Despite the fact that traffic capacity is the main concern of various RTTI-related use cases, lateral clearance constitutes a contextual factor for determining free-flow speed and, in turn, traffic capacity.
