# ðŸ“„ Draft Dictionary Items
This folder contains draft entries for semantic dictionary concepts, written in Markdown format with metadata in front matter. Each file includes:

- YAML frontmatter for metadata (e.g. label, definition, language, status)
- Rich content like text, code, and image references

**Workflow**: Drafts are manually edited. Previews are auto-generated in each commit by `generate_preview.py`, and only approved entries are included in releases.

**Index of working definitions**: [list of definitions with their status](INDEX.md)

**Road classification:**  
the minimum information required for distinguishing the links of a road network encompassing form of way, functional, or other concerns.

> According to ETSI TS 102 894-2 (DE=RoadType), road types are distinguished based on two parameters:  
> (a) urban versus non-urban roads and  
> (b) roads with versus without structural separation to opposite lanes.

> An extended **classification** is provided by the INSPIRE data specification on transport networks... *(truncated)*
