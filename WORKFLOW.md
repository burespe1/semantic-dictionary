# üõ†Ô∏è Definition Processing Workflow

A structured process for refining definitions with explanatory notes, status tracking, and assigned codes.

---

## 1. Initial Capture

- Collect raw definitions from reliable sources.
- Assign preliminary status: `Draft`.
- Add basic metadata (source, category, id, definition, status, subcategory).

---

## 2. Semantic Enrichment

Enhance each definition for clarity and utility.

### üîç Refinement

- Clarify wording and correct inconsistencies.
- Align terminology to domain standards.

### üìù Explanatory Notes

- Provide background context.
- Include usage examples and edge cases.
- Note any assumptions or limitations.

### üß© Tags

- Assign internal tag (e.g., `example`, `notes`).
- Add machine-readable flags for automation purposes.

---

## 3. Review Cycle

- Assign tag `finalised`
- Submit enriched definition for peer or domain expert review.
- Reviewers may:
  - Suggest edits
  - Append comments
  - Approve or reject
- Track all revisions and feedback history.

---

## 4. Approval & Versioning

- Once verified, update status to `approved`.
- Apply versioning (e.g., `v1.2`).
- Freeze content for consistent usage.
- Optionally link to deprecated or related definitions.

---

## 5. Publishing & Discovery

- Upload finalized definitions to glossary or documentation system.
- Enable filtering by:
  - Status
  - Tags
  - Authors
  - Category
- Support full-text search and visibility of notes.

---

## 6. Change Management

- New updates initiate a fresh workflow cycle.
- Maintain changelog for each definition.
- Support rollback or restore previous versions.

|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| `draft`       | Initial, unreviewed definition        |
| `in review`   | Undergoing peer or expert evaluation  |
| `finalised`   | Updated after feedback                |
| `approved`    | Final version, validated              |
| `deprecated`  | No longer in active use               |
